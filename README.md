# 🧩 8-Puzzle Solver

An interactive **8-Puzzle Solver Web App** built with **Flask (Python backend)** and **JavaScript/HTML/CSS frontend**.  
The app allows users to shuffle, solve, and compare multiple search algorithms while visualizing the puzzle-solving process.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Solve the 8-puzzle** using different search algorithms:
  - Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)
  - A* Search (with Misplaced Tiles heuristic)
- ✅ **Puzzle Validation**: Ensures only solvable puzzles can be played.
- ✅ **Shuffle & Reset Buttons** to generate random solvable puzzles.
- ✅ **Step-by-Step Solve Mode**: Watch the puzzle solve itself one move at a time.
- ✅ **Performance Comparison**: Compare algorithms based on:
  - Execution time
  - Number of nodes expanded
  - Solution path length
- ✅ **Responsive UI** with a clean, minimal design.

📊 Algorithm Analysis
Algorithm	Completeness	Optimality	Time Complexity	Space Complexity
DFS	❌	❌	O(b^m)	O(bm)
IDS	✅	✅	O(b^d)	O(bd)
IDDFS	✅	✅	O(b^d)	O(bd)
A*	✅	✅	O(b^d)	O(b^d)

b: branching factor

d: depth of solution

m: maximum depth of search tree
