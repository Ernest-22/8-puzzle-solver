## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Solve the 8-puzzle** using different search algorithms:
  - Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)
  - A* Search (with Misplaced Tiles heuristic)
- ✅ **Puzzle Validation**: Ensures only solvable puzzles can be played.
- ✅ **Shuffle & Reset Buttons** to generate random solvable puzzles.
- ✅ **Step-by-Step Solve Mode**: Watch the puzzle solve itself one move at a time.
- ✅ **Performance Comparison**: Compare algorithms based on:
  - Execution time
  - Number of nodes expanded
  - Solution path length
- ✅ **Responsive UI** with a clean, minimal design.
